                        <i>To my fellow Yellow Jackets—
                            <br />
                            <br />As an incoming student three years ago, I had no idea what to expect from Georgia Tech. In high school I applied to far too many colleges and submitted my Tech application without much thought. Stepping foot on campus for the first time at FASET, I made a conscious decision to make the most of my time here and find value in every experience. From skydiving with freshmen friends, to visiting Alaska through ORGT, to learning (the hard way) that I was not cut out for GT Rugby… I have grown to love Georgia Tech and the community that it represents.
                            <br />
                            <br />As Student Body President, my mission will be to serve you and make your time as a student constructive and enriching. By focusing the efforts of SGA to achieve this central purpose, Brandie and I are confident we can positively impact campus for years to come.
                            <br />
                            <br />My hope for next year is that every student at Tech will find as much significance in his or her experience as I have found in mine. If elected Student Body President, this will be my constant thought as I work to empower the student body to become the leaders and role models of tomorrow.
                            <br />
                            <br />Yours in White and Gold,
                            <br />
                        </i>

                        <i>Fellow Ramblin’ Wrecks,
                            <br />
                            <br />Little did I know when I stepped on campus in the Fall of 2010 how much the next four years would shape me. When I first came to Georgia Tech, I was very unsure of my college decision. However, with time I have grown to love this Institute and the people in it more than I would have thought possible. My time at Tech has been characterized by progress - growth as an engineer and as a person. I owe so much of who I am today to Georgia Tech.
                            <br />
                            <br />If elected, my goal for the year is to empower students, both inside & outside SGA, to be leaders on campus, in the greater Atlanta community, and eventually in the world. Dillon and I plan to do this by streamlining the efforts of SGA into one central purpose: serving the student body and its needs.
                            <br />
                            <br />My love for Georgia Tech and love for other students has lead me to run for the Vice President of the Student Government Association. I want to serve the students of Georgia Tech by pouring my last two semesters into making campus a better place. My desire is for all students to have the same incredible experience I have had the past four years.
                            <br />

                        <strong>What would you say your distinguishing involvement is at Tech?</strong>As a freshman, I'm still just starting to get involved on campus at Georgia Tech. So far, I would say my biggest involvement has been through FreShGA as Co-Head of Advertising, helping to lead a team to advertise for our planned events, One Night Stand and the upcoming Friday Buzz on April 11th.</p>

This Institute does not give you room for complacency, and you are forced to push yourself to be the best that you can be. Tech has helped me become passionate about what I was created for.</p>

                                    <p>One of the largest areas of improvement we see is the relationships between students and faculty. We believe if these are improved, students will learn more because they will respect their professors more.</p>

                                                <li>Students should have the opportunity to get to know their professors, as well as administrators, in a casual setting. We would like to start having professors and administrators in the dining halls and in the student section of sporting events so students have the opportunity to get to know them on a personal level, as well as share their ideas.</li>
                                                <li>Many departments have started using a “Flipped” or “Reverse” classroom approach. We would love to see more innovative teaching styles like these that encourage students to learn hands-on and directly from their professors outside of a lecture format.</li>
                                                <li>We would like to provide students with more opportunities to show their appreciation to good professors by having more initiatives like “Thank a Teacher”. One example would be hosting faculty luncheons.</li>

                                            <li>Dead week policy violations are reviewed each year by administrators, but there is usually very little follow-up to explain what was done to fix the problems. We will work to make this process more transparent.</li>

In order to rectify this, we would like to create a more standardized curriculum for GT1000. We will poll students about what they wish had been covered and incorporate those answers into the curriculum.</li>
                                            <li>The GT1000 experience should equip students to succeed at Tech, teach them about the Institute, and be a lot of fun. We intend on making GT1000 a more hands-on experience by incorporating service projects, a leadership development series with on-campus partnerships with organizations like ORGT, and community activities in the Atlanta area.</li>

                                                    <li>Did you know that 70% of internationals will never be invited into an American’s home? With such an involved alumni base, it is possible to make it so no international student is stuck in the dorms during holidays such as Thanksgiving. If a student wants to, we will match them with another student’s family or an alumni to share a holiday meal with.</li>
                                                    <li>We plan to strengthen the role of the International Student Ambassadors through the Office of Admissions to help ease the transition of our international students.</li>

We want them to have the same connection with Georgia Tech that a “traditional” student has. In order to do that, we will provide transfers the opportunity to be matched with a student in their major who has been at Georgia Tech for awhile so they can have someone to direct all their questions about student life to.</li>

In order to do this, we will work with the Office of New Student and Sophomore Programs to put on “socials” for these groups to get to know each other.</li>
                                                        With our revamping of GT1000, we would like to see sections specifically tailored to transfer students and commuting students.

This causes there to be a lack of unity among the incoming freshman class. A simple way to start building unity amongst classes is by having an incoming “Class Picture”. It will be done at Bobby Dodd every year during RATS week, right before Convocation.</li>
                                            <li>Georgia Tech’s motto is “Progress & Service”. In an effort to have a unifying cause amongst each class, and to further embody this motto, we will instate an “incoming class philanthropy”. Every year at FASET students will vote on a cause to support during their time at Tech, such as hunger, homelessness, or human trafficking. We will work with the Office of Leadership and Civic Engagement to build a committee of students from that will be responsible for helping the class raise funds for the cause, as well as planning hands-on-service projects, for the next 4-5 years. We will encourage competition between incoming classes to see who can serve their cause for the greatest number of hours, and raise the most funds.</li>
